# CSCE221
Data Structures and Algorithms

According to the Texas A&M course catalog, this class is all about: 
"Specification and implementation of basic abstract data types and their associated algorithms including
  stacks, queues, lists, sorting and selection, searching, graphs, and hashing;
    performance tradeoffs of different implementations and asymptotic analysis of running time and memory usage;
      includes the execution of student programs written in C++."

My favorite part of CSCE 221 was learning about circular lists and arrays, and I absolutely loved writing my report on Margaret Hamilton.
